System Revamp is a modernized application designed to scan, analyze, and display the list of installed applications on a user’s system with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Built with a React-based frontend and a Python-powered backend, the project emphasizes both performance and usability. The backend leverages Python scripts to extract installed software details across platforms, while the frontend presents this data in a clean, interactive UI.

The frontend is implemented using React and Material-UI, ensuring responsive design, smooth animations, and easy navigation. It includes a dynamic data table that allows users to search, sort, and paginate through their installed apps efficiently. Real-time updates and filtering mechanisms make it simple to manage large lists of software.

The backend integrates system-level commands to fetch application data, parse it into structured formats, and expose it through REST APIs for the frontend to consume. This separation of concerns provides scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility.

The goal of System Revamp is to give users a centralized hub for system visibility—helping them quickly identify unused, outdated, or suspicious applications. This not only enhances user control but also supports better system health, optimization, and security management.
